### What case are we solving?
It is necessary to write a program that guesses the number in the minimum number of attempts

**Copmetition conditions:**
- The computer guesses an integer from 0 to 100, and we need to guess it. By "guess" is meant "write a program that will guess the number." 
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether a random number is greater or less than the one we need. 

**Quality metric**
The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts with 1000 repetitions

**What we practice**
Learn to write good python code.
